# Breast Cancer Classification

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is a standard breast cancer dataset, and the notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Files Included

- **Main.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps from data loading to model evaluation.
- **breast_cancer_data.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature selection
- Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
